# Digital Nomad Destinations Visualisation

**An interactive dashboard for comparing short-term living conditions across countries, designed for early-stage digital nomads.**

---

## Project Overview

This project visualises and compares global destinations for digital nomads based on internet speed, cost of living, hotel quality, and climate. The app helps users make informed decisions about removte work locations.

- **Target Users:** Early-stage digital nomads who are seeking short-term destinations or planning to relacate.
- **Goal:** Provide evidence-based, multi-featured destination comparison, moving beyond single-factor rankings.

## Key Features

- **Choropleth Map:** Visualise Living Condition Index (LCI_Cond) by country and continent.
- **Cluster Exploration:** View clusters of countries by living conditions.
- **Bubble Plot & Radar Chart:** Compare countries across multiple features interactively.
- **Summary Table:** Numeric comparison with filtering and selection.
- **Full Interactivity:** Click, hover, select features, and get instant visual & numeric feedback.

## Key Metrics

- **Living Condition Index (LCI_Cond):** A composite index combining internet speed, hotel quality, and hotel quantity.
- **Living Cost Index (LCI_Cost):** A composite index combining cost of living + Rent (0.5), grocery cost (0.3), and restaurant price (0.2).
- **Internet Speed:** Average download speed in Mbps.
- **Hotel Rate:** Average hotel rate between 1 to 5.
- **Climate Data:** Average temperature and precipitation for each country.
